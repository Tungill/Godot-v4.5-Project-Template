Use a Folder Named "core" for Key GDScripts and Other Assets

Use a separate folder to handle assets that are absolutely critical to the 
 projectâ€™s operation. For example, basic Singletons, UI, Audio Bus Layout, 
 Event System, and Splash Images should reside here.

For UI, generally, the core folder should only store UIs such as the main menu,
 settings menu, etc., while the HUD within the game should be stored under the 
 game project folder.

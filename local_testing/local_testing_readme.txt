Use a Folder Named "local_testing" for Local Testing

Have a “local_testing” where team members can experiment freely without risking
 the core project. Since this work may be in progress, these team members may
 want to put their assets on the project’s source code management server.

Once the assets are ready for use, they simply moves the assets to the 
 project-specific folder and fixes the redirectors.
This is essentially “promoting” the assets from experimental to production.

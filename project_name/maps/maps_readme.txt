Use a Folder Named "maps" to Store All Map Files

Map scene files are very special, and it's common for each project to have its
 own map naming system, especially when they work with sub-levels or stream
 levels. Levels are usually located in sub-folders of maps, such as
 maps/campaign1/ or maps/arenas, but the most important thing here is that they
 all exist within res://project_name/maps/.

Being able to tell someone to open a specific map without having to explain
 where it is is a great time saver and a general QoL improvement.

-----

The map named "sandbox", should only be used as a testing room for the 3C,:
 features and level-design bricks of the game. This map is different than an
 experimental map (that would belong to the "local_testing" folder). It serves
 to give an overview of the existing features in the game and quickly run
 troubleshooting isolated from game's levels.

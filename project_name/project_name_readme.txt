Use Top-Level Folders for Project Assets

All assets of the project should exist within a folder named after the project.
 For example, if your project is named “shooter”, then all of its content should
 exist within res://shooter/.

If an asset is an experimental test and shouldn't be used by the project it
 should be put in the "local_testing" folder.
